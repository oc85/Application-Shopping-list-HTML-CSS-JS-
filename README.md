## Shopping List Web Application

This project is a simple, interactive shopping list web application that allows users to add, save, load, and manage shopping lists across multiple stores. Each store has its own section where users can input items, cross them out when purchased, and save or load shopping lists from .txt files. This application uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

Features

    * Add Items: Users can input items into the shopping list for a specific store. Once added, items appear as clickable buttons.
    * Cross Out Items: Users can click on an item to cross it out, marking it as "purchased."
    * Save List: Users can save the current shopping list as a text file, which contains the items grouped by stores.
    * Load List: Users can load a previously saved shopping list from a .txt file. The loaded items will replace the current items for each store.
    * Store Sections: The application currently supports three stores: Lidl, Aldi, and Asda. Each store's items are stored separately, and users can toggle between them using shop buttons.

### File Structure

    * HTML (index.html): Provides the basic structure of the application, including sections for each shop and buttons to add items or manage lists.
    * CSS (styles.css): Defines the layout and styling of the buttons, containers, and general interface.
    * JavaScript (script.js): Handles the dynamic interactions, including adding items, saving/loading lists, and toggling between different store views.

### Usage

    * Add Items: Select a shop (e.g., Lidl), type an item in the input field, and press the "Add to Cart" button.
    * Cross Off Items: Click on any item to cross it off, indicating it has been purchased.
    * Save List: Click the "Save" button to download your shopping list as a .txt file.
    * Load List: Click the "Load" button to load a previously saved shopping list. The items will appear under their respective shops.
